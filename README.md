How the game works:
On the left corner of the screen there is a UI panel with three buttons and a check box. By clicking on one of the buttons an object appears on the screen. You can place it anywhere on the ground. When the object is placed on the ground, you can click on it and on the right left corner a new panel appears which is responsible for making the object change colour, position and gives the ability to remove the selected object.
To access the main menu simply click the escape button on your keyboard and then exit button that is showed on the screen.

Disclaimer:
The save button and the load button doesn't work:)
